# Density
This GitHub repository will track all of my projects regarding density analysis and unsupervised learning for my machine learning course.
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled 
datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. 
Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis,
cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

In this course I will focus on the analysis of structured data with the implementation of multiple algorithms and studies:

* Density estimation
* PCA & ICA
* Clustering
